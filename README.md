This project is my first opportunity to exercise how to use SCSS to complement the knowlegede of css learned during the first week at the academy.
We also learned how to dynamically fetch story data and populate it in a webpage via the Top Stories API based a userâ€™s selection from a <select> field and
link each returned image to its URL on the NYT website.
