http://www.philipdu.com/Instanews/

## Summary

Instanews allows users to instantly retreive the top news articles from any particular selected category. 

## Languages and Tools Used

	* HTML5 
	* CSS3 (Flexbox, media queries)
	* SCSS (variables, @mixins, @extends)
	* JavaScript 
	* JQuery
	* AJAX
	* API's
	* Mobile first approach to coding & design (RWD)
	* Gulp

## Learning Outcomes

The Instanews project allowed me to learn and sharpen a multitude of newly aquired skills. The use of Gulp as a task runner for my project allowed me to: run BroswerSync, lint JavaScript files, compile SCSS files into a style.css file, minify my CSS and JavaScript files, and last but not least notify me of any errors made, with messages in my terminal. Additionally, I learned how to pull, parse, and populate content with data that was received from an external web API. Finally, the use of SCSS allowed me to keep a more logically organized style folder using partials, in addition to using @mixins, @extends, as well as simple and logical variables.
